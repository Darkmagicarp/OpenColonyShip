# OpenColonyShip

OpenColonyShip is a game about resource management in space. You can build large ships, send them through space, and gather resources from planets, stars, and asteroids. It is heavily based in science and does not even have FTL drives - you play as an artificial intelligence that can speed up (or slow down) its perception of time when necessary.
