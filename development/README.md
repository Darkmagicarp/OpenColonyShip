# Development

## Engine

We need to choose an engine.

It needs the following:
* 3D support
* 2D support
* Build for Windows/Mac/Linux
* Good AI
* Good speed/reliability
* Easy to use
* Free
* Editor runs on Windows

It would be nice to have:
* Version control via the source folder (in development)
* Open source
* Editor runs on Mac/Linux too

Candidates:
* Unity3D
